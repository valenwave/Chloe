OMG, CGI is like, the most EPIC thing EVER! It's so cool how it lets us create these incredible worlds and characters that are totally out of this world. Like, seriously, it's basically magic but with computers! âœ¨

### What's CGI?

So, **CGI** stands for **Computer-Generated Imagery**, and it's all about using computers to make static images or animated scenes. Think about your favorite movies with crazy special effects, like dragons flying through the sky or superheroes saving the world from aliens. That's CGI! ðŸŽ¬ It's not just for movies, though. CGI is everywhereâ€”in video games, TV commercials, and even in those cool virtual reality experiences. It's how we bring our wildest imaginations to life!

### How Does It Work?

It all starts with a **3D model**, which is like a digital sculpture of whatever you want to create. Artists use special software to build and shape these models. Once the model is ready, they give it a **"skeleton"** so it can move and pose. Then comes the fun part: **texturing and lighting**! They add cool textures to make things look real, like giving a dragon bumpy scales or a car a shiny paint job. And the lighting? That's what makes it all pop and look super realistic. The final step is **rendering**, which is basically when the computer takes all that information and creates the final image or video. It's like baking a cakeâ€”you put all the ingredients in, and the oven (the computer) does the rest! ðŸ’»
